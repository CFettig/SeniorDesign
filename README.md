An online tool for language learners to practice pronunciation.

TODO (in no particular order):
- improve user security 
- ~~compare 2 words and get differing sounds (use cmudict/ARPAbet?)~~
- create researcher view 
- save data on users' preferences and practice
- make photo prompts random
- add written prompts
- add styling
- redesign site to be less dependent on written instructions
- build practice pages for each sound (have practice content for r) 
- give user ability to return to general practice room when done with individual sound
- find a better way to choose individual sound to practice than a list of links
